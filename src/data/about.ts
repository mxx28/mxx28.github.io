I am a Data Science student with an interest in machine learning and statistics. I am still at an early stage of my learning journey and use this website to organize and share notes.

I hope some of the content here may be helpful to others who are also studying similar topics.


# Fun Facts

- I'm a Cities: Skylines addict — I can spend hours designing and tuning virtual cities in games like [Cities: Skylines](https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/cities-skylines/about) until (almost) everything works.
- I secretly enjoy traffic jams… as long as I'm not in a hurry. Watching congestion emerge in a simulation is strangely satisfying (and very educational).
- I love architecture and urban design. Between the ages of 8 and 15, I created 200+ building designs for my own imaginary cities — long before I knew what a real city planner does.
- I'm a loyal NBA Golden State Warriors fan.
- I'm also a Chelsea FC supporter in the Premier League.


# I Dream Of

- Learning deeply and staying genuinely curious about the world.
- Becoming better at turning data into understanding and insight.
- Building things — models, systems, or ideas — that are both useful and meaningful.
